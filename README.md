# all_about_OrangeHRM

Project Description:  <br/>  Automation Framework: Selenium <br/>
Programming Language: Java <br/>
Build Tool: Maven <br/>
Java Version: 1.8<br/>

Notes: 
1. [API Documentation Link](https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/)
2. As OrangeHRM is using OAuth as authentication, we need to create a client through the Admin panel. Please note that the client will be created temporarily. Thatâ€™s why make sure, the client is already created, if not, please create one by going to this URL: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/admin/registerOAuthClient <br/>Use this client Info which I used in the postman collection: <br/>
    <b> ID: webtest </b> <br/>
    <b>Secret: webtest123</b><br/>
After creating the client, you may try running my postman collection.
